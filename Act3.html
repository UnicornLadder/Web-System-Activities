    <p>Algebraic Equation</p>
    <p><b>Algebraic equation</b>, statement of the equality of two expressions formulated by applying to a set of variables the algebraic operations, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising to a power, and extraction of a root. Examples are 
        <i>x² + y² = r²</i> and <i>(x² + 2x - y)/(x - 1) = 12</i>.
    </p>
    <p>An important special case of such equations is that of polynomial equations, expressions of the form <i>ax<sup>n</sup> + bx<sup>n-1</sup> + ... + gx + h = k</i>. 
        They have as many solutions as their degree (<i>n</i>), and the search for their solutions stimulated much of the development of classical and modern algebra. 
        Equations like <i>x sin(x) = c</i> that involve nonalgebraic operations, such as logarithms or trigonometric functions, are said to be transcendental.

    <p>Chemical Compound</p>
    <p>A chemical compound is a chemical substance consisting of two or more different chemically bonded chemical elements, with a fixed ratio determining the composition.</p>
    <p>The ratio of each element is usually expressed by chemical formula.</p>
    <p>For example, water (<b>H<sub>2</sub>O</b>) is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom.</p>
    <p>The atoms within a compound can be held together by a variety of interactions, ranging from covalent bonds to electrostatic forces in ionic bonds.</p>
    <p>A continuum of bond polarities exist between the purely covalent bond (as in H2) and ionic bonds.</p>
    <p>For example, <b>H<sub>2</sub>O</b> is held together by polar covalent bonds.</p>
    <p>Sodium chloride is an example of an ionic compound.</p>
